## What Is a Program?

---

### Quick Hook

Every app you use—calculator, browser, billing software—follows a plan.
That plan is called a **program**.
Before we write Python code, let’s understand *what a program actually is*.

---

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

* Explain what a **program** is in simple terms
* Understand how real-world problems turn into programs
* Identify the **two core parts of any program**
* Recognize how data and operations work together
* Prepare for learning variables and operations next

## Main Content

### 1. What Do We Mean by a Program?

Let’s keep this very simple.

A **program** is a **step-by-step procedure** used to perform a task or solve a problem.

You already follow procedures in daily life:

* Writing steps to solve a math problem
* Following a recipe
* Filling a form in a specific order

You can do all this using **pen and paper**.

Now, imagine you want a **computer** to do the same thing.

For that:

* You must clearly define the steps
* You must write them in a language the computer understands

That written procedure is called a **program**.

So in simple words:

> A program is a **set of instructions** written in a language that a computer can understand and execute.

### 2. Example 1: Area of a Rectangle

Let’s take a very basic example.

Suppose you want to find the **area of a rectangle**.

You already know the formula:

* Area = length × breadth

You can solve this manually.

But now you want the **computer** to do it.

So you write a program that:

* Stores the length
* Stores the breadth
* Applies the formula
* Displays the result

Conceptually, the program looks like this:

* Length = 15
* Breadth = 5
* Area = length × breadth
* Print the area

This is a simple **Python program** that calculates the area of a rectangle.

At this stage, don’t worry about syntax.
Just observe *what the program is doing*.

### 3. Example 2: Calculating a Bill Amount

Let’s look at another real-life problem.

A customer buys multiple products:

* Each product has a **price**
* Each product has a **quantity**

To calculate the bill:

* Multiply price × quantity for each item
* Add all values to get the total amount

You can do this manually.

But again, if you want the **computer** to do it:

* You store prices as data
* You store quantities as data
* You perform calculations
* You display the total bill amount

In the example:

* Prices are stored in one variable
* Quantities are stored in another
* The program multiplies and adds values
* The final total (53) is printed

This is another example of a program.

---

### 4. What Is a Program Made Of?

Now observe both examples carefully.

In both cases, the program has **two major parts**.

#### 1. Data

* Length and breadth
* Prices and quantities

This is the **information** the program works with.

#### 2. Operations (Instructions)

* Multiplication
* Addition
* Displaying results

These are the **actions performed on the data**.

So we can clearly say:

> Every program contains **data** and **operations on that data**.

### 5. What You Need to Learn to Become a Programmer

If programming feels big or scary, break it down.

To learn programming, you only need to master two things:

1. **How to store and manage data**

   * Using variables
   * Understanding data types

2. **How to perform operations on data**

   * Calculations
   * Logical decisions
   * Instructions

Everything else builds on these two ideas.

That’s it.

---

### 6. Why This Lesson Matters

This lesson is not about writing code yet.

It’s about:

* Understanding *what you are trying to do*
* Seeing programs as problem-solving tools
* Building the right mental model before coding

Once this clarity is there, learning Python becomes much easier.

---

## Mini Checkpoint

Think about these questions:

1. What is a program in your own words?
2. What are the two main parts of any program?
3. In the rectangle example, what is the data and what are the operations?
4. Why do we need programs to handle tasks on computers?

---

## Recap

* A program is a step-by-step procedure
* Programs instruct computers to perform tasks
* Programs solve real-world problems
* Every program has data and operations
* Learning programming means learning how to manage data and perform operations

---

## What’s Next

In the next lesson, we’ll start with the **first major part of programming**:
**How to handle and store data in a program** using variables.
