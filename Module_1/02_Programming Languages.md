## Programming Languages

---

### Quick Hook

Every day, we give instructions—to people, to systems, to tools.
But how do *we* give instructions to a computer that doesn’t understand human language?
That question is the foundation of programming.

---

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

* Explain **why languages are needed** for communication and instruction
* Understand **what programming really means**
* Identify the **role of translators** (compiler and interpreter)
* Distinguish between **low-level and high-level programming languages**
* Clearly define what a **programming language** is in simple terms

---

## Main Content

### 1. Why Do We Use Languages?

Let’s start very simply.

When two people talk to each other, they are **communicating**.
And communication always happens using a **language**.

For example:

* Two people talk in **English**
* They may share ideas, stories, opinions, or gossip
* One important use of language is **giving instructions**

Think about:

* A teacher explaining steps to solve a problem
* An employer giving instructions to an employee

Giving instructions means:

* Explaining a procedure
* Showing steps
* Telling *how* to complete a task or solve a problem

Language is the medium that makes this possible.

---

### 2. Programming = Giving Instructions

Now apply the same idea to computers.

We want computers to:

* Perform tasks
* Solve problems
* Follow steps in a specific order

To do that, we must **give instructions** to the computer.

That set of instructions is called a **program**.

And the act of writing those instructions is called **programming**.

So in simple words:

> **Programming means giving a set of instructions to a computer to perform a task.**

---

### 3. The Communication Problem: Humans vs Machines

Here comes the real challenge.

* Humans communicate using languages like English
* Computers do **not** understand English

A computer’s language is **machine language**.

Machine language:

* Consists only of **0s and 1s**
* Is written in **binary**
* Is extremely difficult for humans to read or write

So we have a problem:

* Our language: English
* Machine’s language: Binary (0s and 1s)

They don’t match.

---

### 4. The Need for a Translator

Whenever two parties don’t understand each other’s language, we need a **translator**.

Imagine this situation:

* One person speaks English
* Another person speaks Chinese
* They cannot communicate directly

So we place a **translator** in between.
The translator understands **both languages** and converts one into the other.

The same idea applies to computers.

We need something that:

* Understands **human-friendly language**
* Understands **machine language**
* Converts one into the other

This translator is called:

* a **Compiler**
* or an **Interpreter**

---

### 5. Compiler and Interpreter (Big Picture)

A compiler or interpreter:

* Takes instructions written by the programmer
* Translates them into machine language
* Allows the computer to execute those instructions

At this stage, remember just this:

> **Compiler and interpreter are translators between humans and machines.**

We will go into their differences in the **next lecture**, so don’t worry about details yet.

---

### 6. Where Does Python Fit In?

Python is a **programming language**.

It is not English, but it is **English-like**.
It is designed so that:

* Humans can write it easily
* Translators (compiler/interpreter) can convert it efficiently for machines

Python is a **hybrid language**, meaning:

* It uses both a compiler and an interpreter

So you can think of Python like this:

> You tell Python what you want in a readable way,
> and Python translates it into machine language for the computer.

---

### 7. Types of Programming Languages

Now let’s categorize programming languages.

As a programmer, you should know these two main categories.

---

#### Low-Level Languages

These are very close to the machine.

Examples:

* **Machine language** (0s and 1s)
* **Assembly language** (slightly more readable, but still complex)

Characteristics:

* Very difficult for humans to learn
* Very close to hardware
* Rarely used for general application development

They are called *low-level* because they are close to how the machine works internally.

---

#### High-Level Languages

These are designed for humans.

Examples:

* C
* C++
* Java
* Python
* JavaScript
* PHP

Characteristics:

* Easier to read and write
* English-like syntax
* Use compilers, interpreters, or both

Some are:

* **Compiler-based** (like C, C++)
* **Interpreter-based** (like JavaScript, PHP)
* **Hybrid** (like Python, Java, C#)

Important point:

> A language is designed as compiler-based or interpreter-based **by nature**.
> This is decided when the language is created.

---

### 8. Final Understanding

Let’s connect everything together.

* Humans use language to communicate and give instructions
* Computers understand only machine language (binary)
* Programming is giving instructions to a computer
* Programming languages act as a bridge
* Compiler and interpreter are translators
* Python is a high-level, hybrid programming language
* Python sits between **you** and **the machine**

---

## Mini Checkpoint

Answer these in your own words:

1. Why do we need languages to communicate with computers?
2. What does programming mean?
3. Why can’t computers understand English directly?
4. What is the role of a compiler or interpreter?

---

## Recap

* Language is used for communication and instructions
* Programming means giving instructions to a computer
* Computers understand only machine language (0s and 1s)
* Translators are needed between humans and machines
* Compiler and interpreter perform this translation
* Python is a high-level, hybrid programming language

## What’s Next

In the next lecture, we’ll go deeper into:

* **Compiler vs Interpreter**
* How they work
* How they are different

This will strengthen your foundation before we move further into Python programming.
