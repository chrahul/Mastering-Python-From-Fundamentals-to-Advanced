**Title:** Conditional Statements and Control Flow with Loops
**Lesson Title:** Introduction to While Loop and Loop Execution
---

### **Quick Hook**

Loops are how programs repeat work without repeating code.
Once loops click, programming suddenly feels logical and powerful.
This topic is challenging at first, but mastering it changes everything.

### **Learning Objectives**

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

* Explain what loops are and why they are used
* Identify the two types of loops available in Python
* Understand the basic syntax of a while loop
* Visualize how a loop executes using control flow
* Trace a loop step by step to predict its output

### **Main Content**

#### **What Are Loops**

Loops are used to repeat a set of statements again and again.

Instead of writing the same code multiple times, we write it once and let the loop handle repetition.

This is one of the most important features of any programming language.

If you understand loops well, you are already halfway to becoming comfortable with programming.

#### **Types of Loops in Python**

Python supports two main types of loops:

* while loop
* for loop

Both loops are used for repetition, but they are written differently and used in slightly different situations.

In Python:

* The while loop is condition based
* The for loop works like a for each loop

Even though the for loop is used more often in Python, we start with the while loop because it clearly shows how repetition works.

---

#### **Why Start with the While Loop**

The while loop helps you understand:

* How conditions control repetition
* When a loop starts
* When a loop stops

Once you understand this, learning the for loop becomes much easier.

---

#### **Syntax of the While Loop**

The structure of a while loop looks very similar to an if statement.

You write:

* while followed by a condition
* a colon at the end
* indented statements inside the loop

All indented statements belong to the loop.
Any statement written outside the indentation does not belong to the loop.

---

#### **How the While Loop Works**

Here is the execution flow in simple words:

* The condition is checked first
* If the condition is true, the loop body executes
* After executing the loop body, control goes back to the condition
* This repeats again and again
* When the condition becomes false, the loop stops
* Execution continues after the loop

So the loop keeps running as long as the condition remains true.

---

#### **Control Flow and Visualization**

In a normal program without loops:

* Statements execute one after another in sequence
* Execution starts at the top and ends at the bottom

When a loop is introduced:

* Execution jumps back to the condition
* Some statements repeat
* The flow is no longer straight

This repeating flow is often shown using a flowchart:

* Start
* Check condition
* Execute statements
* Go back to condition
* Exit when condition becomes false

Understanding this flow is more important than memorizing syntax.

---

#### **Understanding Counters**

A counter is a variable whose value changes each time the loop runs.

Counters are used to:

* Count up
* Count down
* Control how many times a loop executes

A counter can be:

* Incrementing, where the value increases
* Decrementing, where the value decreases

---

#### **Tracing a Loop Program**

Instead of directly guessing what a program does, we trace it step by step.

Tracing means:

* Following execution line by line
* Updating variable values mentally
* Observing when the loop stops

In the example shown:

* A variable starts with a value
* The loop prints the value
* The counter decreases by one each time
* The loop stops when the condition becomes false

By tracing, we discovered that the program prints numbers in decreasing order.

This skill of tracing is extremely important when learning loops.

---

### **Mini Checkpoint**

Pause and think about these questions:

* What decides whether a loop continues or stops
* Why must a loop condition eventually become false
* What happens if the counter is never updated
* Why is tracing helpful when learning loops

---

### **Recap**

* Loops repeat a block of code
* Python provides while and for loops
* The while loop runs based on a condition
* Control flow jumps back to the condition in a loop
* Counters help control repetition

---

### **What’s Next**

In the next lesson, we will practice tracing more loop examples and strengthen your understanding before writing programs on your own.
