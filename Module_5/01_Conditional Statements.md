## Title: Conditional Statements

### Quick Hook

So far, your programs could calculate, store, and display data.
But what if your program needs to **make a decision**?
This is where Python starts to feel smart — welcome to conditional statements.

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

* Understand what conditional statements are and why we need them
* Explain how decision making works in a program
* Identify when to use if and else logic
* Recognize the role of relational and logical operators
* Prepare yourself to write real decision based programs

### Main Content

#### Why Conditional Statements Matter

Every real world problem involves decisions.

* If marks are above a limit, pass the student
* If balance is sufficient, allow withdrawal
* If temperature is high, show a warning

Until now, your programs always ran **top to bottom**, without any choice.
Conditional statements introduce **decision making** into your code.

This is a turning point in learning programming.

#### What Are Conditional Statements

A conditional statement allows your program to **choose one path over another** based on a condition.

In simple words:

* If a condition is true, do one thing
* Otherwise, do something else

This decision is made using **conditions**, which always result in either true or false.

#### Core Topics in This Section

In this section, you will learn:

* How to write if and else statements
* How conditions are formed using relational operators
* How logical operators combine multiple conditions
* How conditions behave with different data types
* How to write nested conditional statements
* How Python evaluates decisions step by step

These are **fundamental concepts**, not just Python concepts.
Every programming language relies on them.

---

#### Why These Basics Need Deep Understanding

Conditional statements look simple at first.
But they control the **entire flow** of a program.

If you are not clear about:

* How conditions are evaluated
* How true and false work
* How multiple conditions interact

You will struggle later with loops, functions, and real projects.

That is why we will go **slow, clear, and practical** here.

#### How You Should Practice This Section

To get the best out of this module:

* Practice conditions using pen and paper first
* Predict the output before running the code
* Use any editor you are comfortable with

  * Jupyter Notebook
  * VS Code
  * PyCharm
* Complete every challenge provided
* Do not rush — clarity matters more than speed

Think of this section as **training your logical thinking**, not just learning syntax.

---

### Mini Checkpoint

Take a moment and think:

* What kind of problems need decision making
* What does a condition always evaluate to
* Can a program behave differently for different inputs
* Why do you think conditional logic is required in every language

If these questions make sense, you are ready to move ahead.

---

### Recap

* Conditional statements allow programs to make decisions
* They are a core foundation of programming logic
* Decisions are based on conditions that evaluate to true or false
* This section covers if else logic, operators, and nesting
* Strong basics here will make advanced topics much easier

### What’s Next

In the next lesson, we will start with the **if statement** itself.
You will see how Python checks a condition and executes code selectively — step by step.
